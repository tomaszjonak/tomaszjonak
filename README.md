Rust and cursing at debian buildsystems by day. Go, Python, C, C++ as needed. Probably coding something related to networks.
Bashing my head against DPDK/VPP when required.

Software dev at Graphiant, previously Kentik.

Recruiters pls[^note]

[^note]:
    Reach out via linkedin, that's what it's for.
    Emails stored in some lead db scraped from github are not the best way to reach out.
    My work email may not be the best idea either.
    At least include tech stack.
    There's no reason to say that given opportunity is remote when the next sentence states that it's gonna switch to hybrid whenever cXo feels like it.
